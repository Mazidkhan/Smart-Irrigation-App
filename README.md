# Smart-Irrigation-App
I made this smart irrigation android app in android studio which displays the sensors data like temperature, precipitation and humidity of the farm in the app.
It have features which let the farmers know what is the moisture level of their soil and water their farm from the online motor control system.
It let the farmers know about various crops and the process for their cultivation.
